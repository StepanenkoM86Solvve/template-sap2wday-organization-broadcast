# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of Organizations from SAP to Workday. Every time there is a new organization or a change in an already existing one, SAP will send the IDoc with it to the running template which will create/update an organization in Workday target instance. Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements. As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.	The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages. The integration is triggered by a SAP Endpoint that receives the SAP	Organization as IDoc XML. This XML is passed to the batch process. The batch process handle the migration to Workday.

<!-- Default Considerations (end) -->

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered.
All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (WDAY) systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.

You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** 
These dependencies are private for Mulesoft and will cause you application not to build from a Maven command line. You need to replace them with "provided" scope and copy the libraries into the build path.

## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.

### As a Data Source

The SAP backend system is used as a source of data. The SAP connector is used to send and receive the data from the SAP backend. The connector can either use RFC calls of BAPI functions and/or IDoc messages for data exchange, and needs to be properly customized per the "Properties to Configure" section.

The Partner profile needs to have a customized type of logical system set as partner type. An outbound parameter of message type HRMD\_ABA should be defined in the partner profile. A RFC destination created earlier should be defined as Receiver Port. Idoc Type base type should be set as HRMD\_ABA01.




## Workday Considerations


### As a Data Destination

This template makes use of the `External ID` by Workday.

The templates uses the External ID in order to do xRef between the entities in both systems. The idea is, once an entity is created in WDAY it's decorated with an ID from the source system which will be used afteward for the template to reference it.

### Running on Mule Standalone
Update the properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties, and run your app with a corresponding environment variable. In this example, use `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
When creating your application in CloudHub, go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the mule.env value.

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
The business logic XML file creates or updates objects in the destination system for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this template in this XML file to more meet your needs.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
